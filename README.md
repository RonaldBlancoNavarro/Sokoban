# Sokoban-C++
Project of the Data Structures course, National University of Costa Rica.

This project consists of the implementation of the Sokoban game, a puzzle in which a character must drag boxes to specific locations. The objective is to place all the boxes in their correct location to advance to the next level.

Developed with C++, Object Oriented Programming and SFML for the graphical interface. 
The logical structure is based on an orthogonal linked list that acts as a matrix to load and play levels, which will be stored in text files. 
The player controls the character with the arrow keys, and moves are validated based on the level matrix. A stack is used to detect when all the boxes are in place, indicating the end of the level. The option to save the game and restart levels in case of stalemate is offered.
Language: Spanish.
